# Welcome to the rob301_final_project GitHub Site!

Just a very brief intro into Github:

First some Git Language:
- Branch: A Version of the code
- Master Branch: The latest bug free Version of the Code -> This is not meant for experiments, only for Code that works
- to commit: changing/editing a file and then submitting the change
- pull request: after commiting you send a pull request to ask the other person to check the code, but you can also accept your own pull request 
- conflict: If you change something in the the branch it will show as a conflict. Adding something is not a conflict! only changing code from the master branch. 
- to merge: the act of combining the branch with the master file or any other branch. this will "eliminate" the branch and safe it into the master branch

- There are always one master File which should always be the most recent checked code. If you want to edit it you have 2 Options:

1. You can either edit and commit it directly. I would only do this in minor changes or if you are 100% sure it works. 
2. You create a new branch of the code. This will create a copy of the code for you and let you edit whatever you want, while not changing the main code. When creating and editing a branch it will let you compare it to the master file and tell you if you have conflicts with the master code.

I would always suggest the second option and then just merging the branch once we are sure it works.

I think we won't need more then the 2 Files:
- The main Code
- The Idea file to write our concerns and Ideas in
